# Traffic-Sign-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project applies deep learning using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify traffic signs based on image data. The model is trained on the GTSRB dataset and demonstrates strong performance in recognizing 43 different traffic sign categories. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV.
